# popcornFlix - React App

![Alt text](<Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 11.58.52â€¯am.png>)

## About

This is a React app inspired by Netflix where I had the opportunity to practice my react skills. I used TMDB API to fetch data with trending movies and tv shows. You can search a movie by title or cast. If you like the movie, you can save it in your list of favourites. If you change your mind, you can remove the movie from your list as well.

## Planning & Problem Solving

### Wireframe
    
![Alt text](wireframe-popcornflix.jpg)

This is the wireframe of my project. The idea was to have five rows. The first two will show the trending movies and the trending tv shows. In each card, you have a button where you can save the movie in your list of favourites. The row in the middle is the list of favourites, here you can delete any item you don't want in your list anymore. And the last two rows you can search for a movie by title and by cast and also save in your favourites list.

## Lessons learnt

When you don't have much time to do a project, try to make it simple and to practice the foundation of the technology you're learning. That will help you learning more complex things in the future. Also trello board and wireframe help a lot.
 

## Future features
