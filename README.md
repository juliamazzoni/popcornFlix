## About

This is a React app inspired by Netflix where I had the opportunity to practice my react skills. I used TMDB API to fetch data with trending movies and tv shows. You can search a movie by title or cast. If you like the movie, you can save it in your list of favourites. If you change your mind, you can remove the movie from your list as well.
